## 5. Welcome/Onboarding Text

### Main Welcome Screen:

```
Assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu,
Dear Talib al-'Ilm!

Allah says in the Qur'an:
"Say, 'Are those who know equal to those who do not know?' 
Only they will remember [who are] people of understanding."
(Surah Az-Zumar 39:9)

The Prophet ﷺ said:
"Whoever follows a path in the pursuit of knowledge, 
Allah will make easy for him a path to Paradise."
(Sahih Muslim, Book 34, Hadith 99)

FocusFlow helps you organize your journey of seeking sacred 
knowledge - whether you're studying with SOK Academy, Garden 
of Ilm, your local masjid, or independently.

Stay consistent with:
✓ Daily lesson tracking (even one lesson = 365+ yearly!)
✓ Balance between tool sciences and core sciences
✓ Memorization & revision management  
✓ Building unbreakable study streaks

Remember: Understanding takes time. With revision over months 
and years, difficult points become clear. 

Make it a habit. Stay consistent. Trust the process.

Let's begin by setting up your profile...
```

### After Profile Selection:

#### For Full-Time Talib:
```
Masha'Allah! You've dedicated yourself fully to seeking knowledge.

The Prophet ﷺ said: "Whoever takes a path upon which he seeks 
knowledge, Allah makes easy for him a path to Paradise."
(Sahih Muslim, 2699)

Your schedule includes multiple daily lessons. Remember:
- Alternate between tool sciences and core sciences
- Take breaks between lessons
- Review daily and revise weekly
- Don't burn out - pace yourself for the long journey

May Allah grant you beneficial knowledge!
```

#### For Working Professional:
```
Balancing work and seeking knowledge shows dedication!

Your schedule is optimized for:
- Commute learning (audio lessons)
- Lunch break lessons
- Evening consolidation
- Weekend deep study

Remember: Consistency beats intensity. Even 1-2 lessons 
daily = 365-730 lessons per year!
```

#### For Rabbat al-Usra:
```
Masha'Allah! Seeking knowledge while raising the next generation 
of Muslims is among the greatest deeds.

The Prophet ﷺ said: "The best of you are those who learn the 
Qur'an and teach it." (Sahih al-Bukhari, 5027)

Your schedule is designed around:
- Early morning quiet time
- Flexible mid-day pockets
- Late evening after children sleep
- Audio learning during chores

Remember: Your children will see your love for knowledge.
Small consistent efforts bring great reward!
```

#### For University Student:
```
Combining your studies with Islamic knowledge - excellent choice!

Your schedule fits between classes and uses:
- Morning & evening core times
- Between-class audio lessons
- Post-class focused study
- Semester breaks for intensive learning

Use your breaks to switch to intensive schedules!
```

#### For Limited Availability:
```
Even with limited time, you're making knowledge a priority.

The Prophet ﷺ said: "The most beloved of deeds to Allah are 
those that are most consistent, even if they are small."
(Sahih al-Bukhari, 6464; Sahih Muslim, 782)

Your approach:
- One quality lesson daily
- Short, focused revision
- Weekend consolidation

Consistency, even if small, is beloved to Allah.
```

The Prophet ﷺ said: 'The most beloved of deeds to Allah are 
those that are most consistent, even if they are small.'
(Sahih al-Bukhari, 6464; Sahih Muslim, 782)

Start with 1 and build up naturally. Don't burn out!
```

#### "How do I balance subjects?"
```
Recommended approach:

1. Start with: Qawa'id al-Fiqhiyah + Usul al-Fiqh
   (These principles appear in all other subjects)

2. Add gradually: Pick 2-4 fields total
   - 1-2 from 'Ulum al-Ala (tools)
   - 1-2 from 'Ulum al-Maqasid (core sciences)

3. Example weekly split:
   - Mon: Qawa'id al-Fiqhiyah
   - Tue: Aqidah/Tawheed
   - Wed: Usul al-Fiqh
   - Thu: Fiqh
   - Fri: Light/Revision
   - Weekend: Extra lessons + deep revision
```

#### "What if I miss a day?"
```
Life happens! 

✓ Don't give up - resume immediately
✓ Don't try to "catch up" by cramming
✓ Just continue with today's lesson
✓ Use weekend for any needed revision

The goal is long-term consistency, not perfection.
```

#### "When should I revise vs. learn new content?"
```
Both are essential:

Daily Quick Revision (15-30 min):
- Scan marked pages from this week
- Review yesterday's notes
- Quick memorization review

Weekly Deep Revision (1-3 hours):
- Review entire week's lessons
- Go back to difficult concepts
- Consolidate notes
- Test yourself on key points

Monthly/Quarterly:
- Return to completed books
- Review from beginning
- Note your growth in understanding

Remember: Revision over months and years 
turns difficulty into clarity.
```

### Study Methodology

#### "How to Take Notes"
```
SOK Academy Method:

✓ Write in PEN (not pencil) in your books
✓ Underline key points
✓ Use symbols for must-memorize items (★ ⭐)
✓ Fold corner of important pages
✓ Add bookmarks for special benefits
✓ Create your own symbol system

For PDF annotations:
✓ Highlight in different colors
✓ Add marginal notes
✓ Create bookmarks digitally
✓ Keep "what to memorize" PDFs handy

Goal: Quick scanning during revision
```

#### "PDF vs. Printed Books"
```
Use BOTH:

PDFs are great for:
✓ Portability
✓ Searching text
✓ Digital annotations
✓ "What to memorize" files
✓ Some explanations exist only as PDFs

Printed Books are essential for:
✓ Long-term retention
✓ Physical interaction (pen, folding, bookmarks)
✓ Quick revision by flipping to marked pages
✓ Many tahqiq works only in print
✓ Detailed footnotes

Ideal setup: 
- Tablet/laptop for PDFs
- Key textbooks in print
```

#### "Memorization Workflow"
```
SOK Academy provides "what to memorize" PDFs:

1. After lesson: Open the memorization PDF
2. Must-memorize items: Priority
3. Optional items: Read repeatedly

Process:
- New item: Repeat 10-20 times daily for 3-5 days
- Move to: Every other day for a week
- Then: Weekly review
- Then: Monthly review

Tip: Reading optional items repeatedly helps 
you remember meanings even without full memorization.

Key ayat & ahadith per lesson example:
Al-Usul al-Thalatha = 70+ evidences to work through
```

#### "Using This App with SOK/Garden of Ilm"
```
Integration:

1. Watch lesson on SOK/Garden of Ilm
2. Mark as "completed" in FocusFlow
3. Schedule note-taking time in app
4. Add memorization from PDF to daily tasks
5. Track revision sessions
6. Use analytics to ensure balance

Think of FocusFlow as your study habit tracker
and organizer - not a replacement for the actual
learning platforms.
```

### Mindset & Long-Term Success

#### "Understanding Takes Time"
```
Level 1 includes material for beginners, 
intermediate, AND advanced students.

First Time Through: Familiarization
  "I've heard of this concept"

After Weeks: Recognition  
  "I remember covering this"

After Months: Understanding
  "Now I see how this fits together"

After Years: Mastery
  "I can explain and teach this"

Be patient with yourself. The scholars spent
decades in study. You're building a foundation.
```

#### "Avoiding Burnout"
```
Warning signs:
⚠️ Dreading study time
⚠️ Constantly behind schedule
⚠️ Feeling guilty instead of motivated
⚠️ Sleep deprivation
⚠️ Neglecting family/health

Solutions:
✅ Reduce daily minimum temporarily
✅ Take a planned break (1-2 days, not quitting)
✅ Switch to lighter subjects
✅ Do only revision for a week
✅ Adjust schedule to be more realistic

Remember: This is a marathon, not a sprint.
Sustainable pace > Temporary intensity
```

#### "Seeking vs. Hoarding Knowledge"
```
True seeking of knowledge includes:

✓ Understanding what you memorize
✓ Learning the rulings (Fiqh)
✓ Acting upon what you learn
✓ Teaching family and close ones
✓ Connecting knowledge to worship
✓ Sincerity in seeking Allah's pleasure

The Prophet ﷺ said: 'The best of you are those who 
learn the Qur'an and teach it.' (Sahih al-Bukhari, 5027)

Don't just collect lessons - 
let knowledge transform you.
```
